# Ponder

A framework for building blockchain-enabled web services

## Features

- Support for ~80% of Graph Protocol subgraph features
- Event handlers run in Node.js (import packages, send HTTP requests, etc)
- Local development server with hot reloading
- Support for any EVM-based blockchain (just need an RPC URL)

## Quickstart

##### 1. Run `npx create-ponder-app`

```
npx create-ponder-app path/to/ponder-app
```

Include the `--from-subgraph` option to bootstrap a ponder app using a Graph Protocol subgraph

```
npx create-ponder-app path/to/ponder-app --from-subgraph path/to/subgraph
```

##### 2. Start the development server

```
cd path/to/ponder-app
npm run dev
```

The dev server process will print logs to help you handle any configuration issues or errors.

##### 3. Add event sources

The `ponder.config.js` file defines the event sources (EVM smart contracts) that Ponder will index. You can include contracts across multiple chains. You can also use any environment variables defined in `.env.local`.

##### 4. Write event handler functions

The `handlers/` directory contains a file for each source defined in `ponder.config.js`, and an `index.ts` file. The `index.ts` file must export an object that maps event names to event handler functions.

That's it! The development server should reload and reindex whenever you save changes in any project file.

## Deploying to production

Ponder apps can be deployed on any cloud provider that offers a Node.js web service runtime.

## Docs

### Project files

##### 1. `ponder.config.js`

This file contains contract addresses, paths to ABIs, and RPC URLs for each of your sources. It is analogous to a subgraph's `subgraph.yaml` file.

##### 2. `schema.graphql`

This file works exactly like a subgraph's `schema.graphql`. It supports the `@entity` and `@derivedFrom("field")` directives.

##### 3. `handlers/`

This directory contains your event handler functions. Ponder uses these functions to process blockchain events. Event handlers can create and update Entities, which are served by the autogenerated GraphQL API.

Event handler files run in Node.js (not WebAssembly), so you can import NPM packages, send HTTP requests, and so on.

##### 4. `abis/`

This directory contains the ABIs for your contracts. You can download these files from Etherscan, or (more likely) generate them from a local smart contract development tool like Hardhat or Foundry.

##### 5. `generated/`

This gitignored directory stores autogenerated Typescript types for your handler files to import. It also contains the final schema that is served by the GraphQL API.

##### 6. `.ponder/`

This gitignored directory stores ponder's internal cache store and the compiled handler code. You shouldn't need to worry about it, but if you delete it, ponder will need to refetch any cached logs from the RPC.
