# Deploy to production

## Railway (recommended)

[Railway](https://railway.app) is currently the best place to deploy Ponder apps. Most Ponder apps cost ~$5 per month, and the deployment process is simple.

<div className="steps-container">

### Update `ponder.config.js`

In production, Ponder apps use Postgres. Update your `ponder.config.js` file to use Postgres in production, and SQLite in development. Railway automatically provides the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

```js filename="ponder.config.js"
const ponderConfig = {
  database:
    process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"
      ? {
          kind: "postgres",
          connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL
        }
      : {
          kind: "sqlite"
        }
  // ...
};
```

Commit your changes to `ponder.config.js` and push your repo to GitHub.

### Sign up or log in to Railway

### Create a Ponder app service

From the Railway console:

1. Click **New Project**
2. Click **Deploy from GitHub repo**, then select your repo from the list
3. Click **Add variables**, then add your project's RPC URL (e.g. `PONDER_RPC_URL_1`) and any other environment variables your project needs

<Callout type="warning">
  **Monorepo users:** Go to the “Settings” tab for your server and update the
  “Root Directory” accordingly.
</Callout>

### Create a Postgres database service

From your project's dashboard, click **New** → **Database** → **Add PostgreSQL**.

After a moment, your Ponder service should redeploy successfully. Check the Build Logs and Deploy Logs tabs to debug any deployment issues.

## Other cloud providers

Ponder has not been thoroughly tested on cloud providers other than Railway. However, Ponder apps should work in any environment that supports Node.js and can connect to a Postgres database.
