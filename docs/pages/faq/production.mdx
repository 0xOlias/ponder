# Deploying to production

## Render

It's very easy to deploy Ponder apps to [Render](https://render.com), a Heroku-like cloud provider.

### Update `ponder.config.js`

In production, Ponder apps use Postgres. Update your `ponder.config.js` file to use Postgres in production, and SQLite in development. Render will provide the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

```js filename="ponder.config.js"
module.exports = {
    database: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"
      ? {
          kind: "postgres",
          connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
        }
      : {
          kind: "sqlite",
        },
    ...
}
```

### Create `render.yaml`

Render supports infrastructure-as-code using their Blueprint product. If you created your project with `create-ponder` CLI, this file was autogenerated for you.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Monorepo users:** The `render.yaml` file must be at the root of your git
  repository. If you're using a monorepo, you will have to move the file to the
  repository root and specify the `rootDir` path for the web service. See the
  [Render docs](https://render.com/docs/blueprint-spec#root-directory) for more
  details.
</Callout>

```yaml filename="render.yaml"
services:
  - type: web
    name: my-ponder-app # Rename this to your project name
    env: node
    buildCommand: pnpm install # Or yarn, npm
    startCommand: pnpm start # Or yarn, npm
    envVars:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        fromDatabase:
          name: my-ponder-db
          property: connectionString
      # Include any environment variables that your project needs
      - key: PONDER_RPC_URL_1
        sync: false

databases:
  - name: my-ponder-db
    postgresMajorVersion: 14
```

### Render steps

Once you've committed any changes to `ponder.config.js` and `render.yaml`, you are ready to deploy your project to Render!

1. Sign up for Render and connect your GitHub or GitLab account.
2. Go to the dashboard, click **New +**, then click **Blueprint**.
3. Find your Ponder app in the list of repositories and click **Connect**.
4. Give your service group a name, then click **Create New Resources**.

## Other cloud providers (Railway, AWS, etc)

Ponder has not been thoroughly tested on cloud providers other than Render. However, Ponder apps should work in any environment that supports Node.js and can connect to a Postgres database. If you're attempting to host a Ponder app elsewhere, the sample `render.yaml` above might be helpful.
