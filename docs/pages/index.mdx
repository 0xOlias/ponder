# Ponder

Ponder is an open-source framework for building frontend-ready APIs that serve blockchain data.

<Callout type="warning">
  Today, the _only_ supported use case for Ponder is building a GraphQL API from
  blockchain event logs.
</Callout>

Over time, Ponder aims to solve for more use cases, like sending arbitrary
networks requests in response to blockchain events, building non-GraphQL APIs,
and integrating with services like Discord, Slack, and Sendgrid.

## Architecture overview

<Callout type="info">
  Ponder's architecture is very similar to Graph Protocol subgraphs. If you're
  familiar with building subgraphs, you can skip to [Getting
  started](/getting-started).
</Callout>

**_TODO_** Figure 1: Blockchain events → Event handler functions → Entity database → GraphQL API → Client app

## Simple example

Suppose that this smart contract has been deployed to Ethereum mainnet at `0x283...7f5`.

```solidity filename="EthereumNameService.sol"
contract EthereumNameService {
  event NameRegistered(string name, address owner);

  function registerName(string calldata name, address owner) external {
    // ...

    emit NameRegistered(name, owner);
  }
}
```

Now, let's add this smart contract as a Source in our Ponder config file. The indexing engine will fetch all the `NameRegistered` events that have been emitted by the contract.

```ts filename="ponder.config.js"
const config = {
  networks: [
    {
      name: "mainnet",
      chainId: 1,
      rpcUrl: "https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/...",
    },
  ],
  sources: [
    {
      name: "EthereumNameService",
      network: "mainnet",
      abi: "./abis/EthereumNameService.json",
      address: "0x283...7f5",
    },
  ],
};

module.exports = config;
```

The original goal was to create a GraphQL API to serve `EthereumNameService` data. Here's a schema file that defines a `Name` entity, which corresponds to a newly registered name.

```graphql filename="schema.graphql"
type Name {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  owner: String!
  updatedAt: Int!
}
```

Now, we need to write an event handler function that will process the `NameRegistered` event. Event handlers are JavaScript functions that accept a contract event and insert data into the Entity Store.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts filename="EthereumNameService.ts"
async function handleNameRegistered(event, context) {
  const { Name } = context.entities

  await Name.insert(name, {
    id: `${owner}-${name}`,
    name: event.params.name,
    owner: event.params.owner,
    updatedAt: event.block.timestamp,
  })
}

export const { 
  NameRegistered: handleNameRegistered
};
```

Ponder automatically generates a GraphQL API that serves data from the Entity Store.
