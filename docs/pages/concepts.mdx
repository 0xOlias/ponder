# The basics

_Note to subgraph developers_ Inset: If you're familiar with the Graph Protocol, you can think of Ponder as an alternative to Graph Protocol subgraphs that aims to have a much better developer experience. Many of the concepts are the same, and you can probably go on to [next page].

Ponder is a framework for building APIs that serve data from Ethereum smart contracts.

Key steps:

1. Select smart contracts to be indexed (in `ponder.config.js`)
2. Define the schema of the GraphQL API (in `schema.graphql`)
3. Write functions that accept contract event logs and insert entities into the database
