# `schema.graphql`

Ponder currently supports a subset of the Graph Protocol schema definition language. Please [reference the Graph's documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#the-graph-ql-schema) for more detailed documentation.

<Callout type="warning">
  In a future release, Ponder will likely deprecate the Graph Protocol schema
  definition language in favor of a Ponder-native approach. To make this
  eventual migration easier, avoid using new & advanced Graph Protocol features.
