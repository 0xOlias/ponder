# Project layout

### `ponder.config.js`

This file contains contract addresses, paths to ABIs, and RPC URLs for each of your sources. It is analogous to a subgraph's `subgraph.yaml` file.

### `schema.graphql`

This file works exactly like a subgraph's `schema.graphql`. It supports the `@entity` and `@derivedFrom("field")` directives.

### `handlers/`

This directory contains your event handler functions. Ponder uses these functions to process blockchain events. Event handlers can create and update Entities, which are served by the autogenerated GraphQL API.

### `abis/`

This directory contains the ABIs for your contracts. You can download these files from Etherscan, or (more likely) generate them from a local smart contract development tool like Hardhat or Foundry.

### `generated/`

This gitignored directory stores autogenerated Typescript types for your handler files to import. It also contains the final schema that is served by the GraphQL API.

### `.ponder/`

This gitignored directory stores ponder's internal cache store and the compiled handler code. You shouldn't need to worry about it, but if you delete it, ponder will need to refetch any cached logs from the RPC.
