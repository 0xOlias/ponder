# ponder

A local development server for building APIs on top of blockchain data.

## Features

- Fully compatible with existing subgraphs (The Graph) ðŸŸ¡
- Hot reload on changes to all project files âœ…
- Support for any EVM-based blockchain (just need an RPC URL) âœ…
- Caches logs locally for faster reindexing âœ…

## Quickstart

### 1. I already have a subgraph and I'm adding ponder as a local dev server

1. Install `@ponder/ponder` as a dev dependency:

```
npm install -D @ponder/ponder
```

2. Add a script to your `package.json`:

```
"dev": "ponder dev"
```

3. Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

The console will display useful logs and help you handle any errors.

### 2. I'm starting a new ponder project

To create a new ponder project, run

```
npx create-ponder-app
```

and respond to the prompts accordingly. This will generate a (tiny!) project directory to get you started. Open `ponder.config.js` and follow the trail of comments from there!

## Docs

### Project layout

#### 1. `ponder.config.js`

This file is analogous to the a subgraph's `subgraph.yaml` file. It contains contract addresses, paths to ABIs, and RPC URLs for each of your sources (contracts).

#### 2. `schema.graphql`

This file works exactly like a subgraph `schema.graphql`. It supports the `@entity` and `@derivedFrom("field")` directives.

#### 3. `handlers/`

This directory contains your contract event handlers. Ponder uses these functions to process blockchain events. Event handlers insert and update entities, which get served by the GraphQL API.

#### 4. `abis/`

This directory contains the ABIs for your contracts. You can download these files from Etherscan, or (more likely) generate them from a local smart contract development tool like Hardhat or Foundry.

#### 5. `generated/`

This gitignored directory stores autogenerated Typescript types for your handler files to import. It also contains the final schema that is served by the GraphQL API.

#### 6. `.ponder/`

This gitignored directory stores the log cache and the compiled handler code that the ponder uses to process lgos. You shouldn't need to worry about it, but if you delete it, ponder will need to refetch any cached logs from the RPC.

## About

### Goals

- Be the best local development tool for blockchain app developers
- Work seamlessly alongside tools like Foundry and Next.js

### Non-goals

- Efficiently index massive amounts of data
- Serve analytics queries/workloads
